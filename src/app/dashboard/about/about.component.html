    <h1>SPHINX Vulnerability Assessment as a Service</h1>

    <h2>Version:</h2>
    <br>

    SPHINX Holistic Cybersecurity validation toolkit will provide an automated Vulnerability Assessment, to deal with specific
    tasks and reduce the attack surface.
    Following an Incremental strategy we will use Logging systems such as SysLog or CEF(Common Event Format)
    to be able to utilise and connect with existing systems providing analysed events reducing the day to day overhead
    in event correlation handling.
